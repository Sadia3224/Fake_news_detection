## üìù Project Description

This project utilizes a trained machine learning model (such as **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, or **PassiveAggressiveClassifier**) to detect fake news. Users can input any news content into the web app, and the system predicts its authenticity based on trained patterns in the dataset.

The frontend is styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap**, while the backend is built with **Flask**. The app includes four main pages:
